config MODEM_RECEIVER

	depends on SERIAL_SUPPORT_INTERRUPT
	select UART_INTERRUPT_DRIVEN
	select RING_BUFFER
	help
	  This driver allows modem drivers to communicate over UART with custom
	  defined protocols. Driver doesn't inspect received data and all
	  aspects of received protocol data are handled by application via
	  work method provided.  This driver differs from the pipe UART driver
	  in that callbacks are executed in a different work queue and data is
	  passed around in k_pipe structures.

config MODEM_RECEIVER_MAX_CONTEXTS
	int "Maximum number of modem receiver contexts"
	depends on MODEM_RECEIVER
	range 1 10
	default 1
	help
	  Maximum number of modem receiver contexts to handle.  For most
	  purposes this should stay at 1.

config MODEM_SHELL
	bool "Enable modem shell utilities"
	select SHELL
	help
	  Activate shell module that provides modem utilities like
	  sending a command to the modem UART.

	  Choose this setting to enable Sierra Wireless HL7800 LTE-M/NB-IoT modem driver.

	int "Size of the stack for the HL7800 modem driver RX thread"

	  This stack is used by the HL7800 RX thread.

	int "Size of the stack for the HL7800 modem driver work queue"
	depends on MODEM_HL7800

	help
	  This stack is used by the work queue to pass off net_pkt data
	  to the rest of the network stack, letting the rx thread continue
	  processing data.

config MODEM_HL7800_APN_NAME
	string "APN name for establishing network connection"
	depends on MODEM_HL7800
	default "jtm2m"
	help
	  This setting is used in the AT+KCNXCFG command to set the APN name
	  for the network connection context.  Normally, don't need to change
	  this value.

config MODEM_HL7800_INIT_PRIORITY
	int "HL7800 driver init priority"
	depends on MODEM_HL7800
	default 80
	help
	  HL7800 device driver initialization priority.
	  Do not mess with it unless you know what you are doing.
	  Note that the priority needs to be lower than the net stack
	  so that it can start before the networking sub-system.
